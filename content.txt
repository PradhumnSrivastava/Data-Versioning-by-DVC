1. Creating Git repo and clone it.
2. Create mycode.py and write code in it. (It will save a csv file to new 'data' folder.)
3. Do a git commit before initializing. 
# installing DVC -- pin install dvc
4. Now we do dvc.init. (creates .dcvignore, .dvc)
5. Now we do 'mkdir S3' (create a new S3 Directory)
6. Now we will do 'dvc remote add -d myremote S3'.
7. Next 'dvc add data/'
 Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and git commit -m "Stop Tracking data")
 because initially we were tracking it through git so now we have to remove it from git and handel it to dvc.
 8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (created data.dvc) then git add .gitignore data.dvc"
 9. Now "dvc commit" and "dvc  push"
 10. Now We will make changes in mycode.py and check change via "dvc status"
 11. Now "dvc commit" and "dvc  push"
